# Calculator (first python project)
# I included a description on how to use this very, very basic calculator in the code as a comment but I will also put it here:

# How To Use:
# change x and y variables from 3,3 desired numbers
# delete '#' before print statement that coresponds to changes variable
# ---------------
# ex. to add 4 and 6:
# 1. change a = add(3,3) to a = add(4,6)
# 2. delete the '#' before print(a) - making statement live 
# this will print 'a' which adds x and y variables which we set to 4 and 6 (output will be 10)

# Thanks
